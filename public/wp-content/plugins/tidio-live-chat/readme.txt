Our app merges live chat and chatbots in one tool to help you skyrocket your sales and level of customer service. Imagine that a potential client wants to leave you; the Tidio Chatbot can engage them 24/7 (you don’t even have to be online!), offering them help in case of an issue, or asking them for an email address for later contact. Your client is happy, and you have a new lead. Isn’t that excellent customer service?

= How does it work? =
Right after you install, open the “Tidio Chat” tab, and you’re ready to go! A chat widget will be visible on your website, so your visitors can contact you in real time. Once you access the Tidio dashboard, you can reply to any incoming chats, configure Chatbots, and manage other settings.
